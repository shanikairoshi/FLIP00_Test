In this study we propose prediction model to predict air pollution components which are specified as carbon monoxide, benzene and nitrous oxide. We uses multiple predictors such as temperature, absolute and relative humidity and five sensor data.
We identify that these predictors are correlated among each other and we use rigid linear regression instead general linear regression method to hinder the impact of multicollinearity in this study.
We clearly show the performance efficiency of proposed 
models using determination of coefficient, bias and variance scores for each models.
We derive 95\%, 82\% and 68\% determination of coefficient for the model of benzene, carbon monoxide and nitroos oxide respectively.
